This repository is my attempt at implementing the Continuous Thought Machine (CTM) from [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05522) paper.  
The dataset i use can be found at [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ir74RtLGd_roajcRsfwugpe3IvP5oUZD/view?usp=sharing).  


# current results
When training with an rtx 3060 12GB for 4 hours the model learns to predict 2-3 points accurately but dosen't learn to "look around".
This might be because of the short training time or simplicity of the dataset.
