This repository is my attempt at implementing the Continuous Thought Machine (CTM) from [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05522) paper.  
The dataset can be found at [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ir74RtLGd_roajcRsfwugpe3IvP5oUZD/view?usp=sharing).  


current models:
  - model_512.pt: trained with pretrained feature extractor  
  - model512_2.pt: trained without pretrained feature extractor  
  - model512_3.pt: trained with a pretrained feature extractor and larger images  

show.py is a python script for visualiseing the predictions
